# Hyperbolic Poincare Disk Geometry
A simple graphing utility for creating geodesic segments in the Poincare Disk Model.

## Overview
This was a project I worked on for my Non-Euclidean Geometry class at the University of Missouri. The project was simply to draw Einstein in this particular model of Hyperbolic Geometry, so I wrote some python to give me a canvas to do so. It's fun to play with and can further one's understanding of geodesics in this geometric model. 

## Tools used 
scikit-image (http://scikit-image.org/): I used their canny edge detection to outline Einstein's Face so I could actually draw him.

matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/): This is the backbone of the actual graphing itself.
